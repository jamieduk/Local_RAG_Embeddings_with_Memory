\i Psychoenergetic Systems 1974, Vol.1, pp.3-10 _ IMPLI The laws of physics, as we “know them, are all formulated in terms of the concept of space-time.However, space-time is a concept of limited validity."The general theory of relativity predicts the gravita- tional coliapse of space-time to a “singularity.” That is, the concept of space-time as a collection of focalized point-like cvents self-destructs or spon- taneously breaks, down.The conventional laws of physics are transcended.Professor John A.Wheeler (1974) has called this the “mutability principle.” in particular, concepts of energy, momentum and glar momentum are not even definabie in a soatially closed universe nor are they even gencrally conserved in the presence of curvature.Corscrva- tion laws are the result of symmetry properties of space-time and curvature ge ly destroys these symmeiries.The corcivaiivn of Cucrgy is Got on ultimate immutable truth of modern theoretical physics.
If space-time is not fundamental but is a derived order from something mere fundamental, then what is the primordial “pregeometry” from which space-time is created? ft is the Quantum Principle.‘The full meaning of quantum theory is still in the stage ef being bora.In my opinion, the quantum principle involves mind in an essential way along the lines suggested, by Parmenedes and Bishop Berkeley, ‘ Oifiets.Professor Eugene Wigner (1972) nas said that thc next revolution in thearetical physics will occur whea the properties of mind are explicitly included im the equations of quantum theory.Psyche-energctics will not be properly formulated until the dceper meanings of the quan- tum principle are further clarified.Wheeler has, suggested that the quantum principle can be for- rary mulated as a logical calculus of two-valued yes-no”’ of propositions.
Professor Roger Penrose (19s) has made some progress on how the combinatorics of yes-no propositions implies three-dimensional struc- ture of sosce. A miore basic question is who or what is the “participator” formulating the pro- position from which matter existing in space-time va Pooreny oddress : Tastitst erodes tal Qtudies ef 3 Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/01/09 : CIA-RDP79-009994000200010077-1 © Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Lid.oo Printed in Northern Ireland | CATIONS OF META-PHYSICS FOR o> S"PSYCHOENERGETIC SYTEMS JACK SARFATT., International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Ttaly is derived.Mind appears to be the function of low- entropy, highly organised dissipative structures of matter in space-time that are held far from thermo- dynamic equilibrium by the negative entropy flow of matter and energy (I.Prigogine, 1972).Mind creates matter and is also a function of matter.
This is a self-consistent process or “bootstrap” characteristic of non-linear processes.” The quantum principle transcends local concep- tions of space-time and is intrinsically nonlocal in character. Professor David Bohm (1974) has said that conventional formulations ‘cf quantum mechanics imply that individual quantuin particles cannot generally be isolated from the unbroken wholeness of the entire universe.A quantum potential provides a ubiquitous and universal interconnectednece among all narts of the whole: Even when the classical potential vanishes (so that in the usual interpretation of the theory it is said that the twe particles do not interact) there is still a “quantum Inter- action” between.them which does not appr y ZrO aS (X%, — X)—the separation between the two particles—~ approaches macroscepic dimensions and wh desends on the quantum state of the whole system (Bohm and Hilcy, 1974}..
: In my view, the Bohm—Hiles (1974) quantum De Broglie potential proceeds from a self-organising principle which creates space-time and is also, at least in part, manifested as a functional order connected with non-cquilbrium disspative structures. it is now clear whether this correlation is fundamental or fortuitious, That it is the former is a basic pre- ing the mainstream of modern science.Anidea of the atmost significance for the develop- ment of psycho-energetic systems that is implicit in the above considerations is that the structure of .matter may not be vesmexceee The first hint of this [?is dimly seen in the “Copenhagen interpretation” of quantum measurement as “reduction of the wavepacket.” The idea becomes more explicit in the Elnstcin-Roser--Poldolsky “Paradox” in which two R ' 47; Ropert lobes, nate Morta Orchard 4 Chicage palliasixs GobI4-, “ws.a.

Indeed, a signal has, in general, to be a complex structure, consisting of many events, that are ordered in definite ways (Bohm and Hiley, 1974). Bohm and Hiley leave the question unanswered.I suggest the meta-physical hypothesis that the quantum mechanical wave function is a property of the self-organising principle which creates space- _, time.The prefix meta here refers to Geedel'’s Sf thea!reference forthe need feeders outside the Clssed system of physical theory for the Sistentse ce pebet of preystiteasn a “a This leads to new predictions of a psychoenergetic nature that can be tested in the laboratory.: .According to conventional!interpretations of the _ quantum principle, if we shoot an electron or photon beam through a double slit and allow the scattered beam to fall on a detecting screen, then the exact place of impact of an indiydual photonisy or electron cannot bé predicted.Only the proba- bility of a particular place of impact can be pre- ‘dicted.
To test this particular prediction requires the use of a good statistical sample insolving a vi Jarge number of photons or electrons. However, .according to Dirac, the probability aspect of the quantum principle is not a colicctive property of the _ Interactions between the severat electrons or pro- -tons i.¢, each photon (electron) “interferes with itself.” This is “proved” by observation of double- \.sht interference patterns even when the incident flux of photons or electrons is so low that on the average only one photon or electron is present in the experimental apparatus at any one time.The existence.of Bohm’s cuantunt potential may imply: that Dirac’s interpretation is not quite correct though it points io a profound truth.

It.is’ not without.interest that this should be occurring at About the?" same time that science is having to confront a | number of extremely difficult problems, “Whether one chooses the framework of Kuhn’ S -€1962} paradigms or Holton’s (1973) themata, for example, .it would seem that one of the most useful things --such debates could provide might be some guidance’ - selves facec a build-up of anomalies or other unexpected phenomena.As Kuhn so aptly phras it: .: for science ma) scientists) when they find them- wih, .
One of the things that a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm. is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions.To a great extent these are the only problems that “the community will admit as scientific or encourage its members to undertake.Other problems, including many that had previously been standard, are rejected as metaphysical, - ag the concern of another discipline, or sometimes as just too problematic to be worth the time.For example, the problems suggested by the anoma- lies of psychic research have the dubious distinction of having been rejected, at one time or another, on all’ three grounds suggested by Kuhn above.However, as Kuhn also points out, perhaps we should not be too surprised at this since: _ Discovering a new sort of phenomenon is necessarily a _ complex event, one which involves recognizing beth thet something is and whar it is....
Only when the reicvant conceptual categories are prepared in advance, in which case the phenomenon would not be of a new sort, can dis- covering what occur effortlessly, together, and in an instant. Thus for some of us, it has always seemed more potentially productive to examine the progress of .research on paradoxes that have emerged within the framework of conventional physics, for example, “especially if those paradoxes share some funda- mental characteristics with the phenomena that have been rejected.{1 this connection, it should be obvious that many of the questions raised by psychic research have much in common.with a -PHYSICS FOR PSYCHOENERGETIC s¥__JMs problems in the areas of conventional measurement theory and modern research into both quantum theory and relativity research.
Yet at the same time, it has also been clear that an essential component ‘would be being ignored by such an approach since it would take no account of the fact that highly : cordplex biological /iving systems are involved in sychic phenomena. The special problems posed living systems, which are open and nonequili- im systeins, are now being given consideration -in the work of Prigogine (1972) as well as in Eigen’s (1971) work on the ‘‘self-organization” of matter ‘in biological systems.it has also been obvious for “some time that somehow, developments in these ‘different areas would have to be combined in such a way that the consciousness of the observer- participator is indeed part of the resulting theory” in a way that constitutes a genuine response to Wigaer’s (1972) complaint that from the point of view of quantum mechanics, consciousness is comple etely unexplained.
(in this connection, it is interesting tc note that Wigner expressed the view that one of the only ways of solving this was to find phenomena “in which the consciousness modifies the Jaws of physics.) Given the div of the kinds of information needing integration, it is perhaps not surprising that the field of contendors is not exactly crowded. In the preceding paper, Sarfatt has presented’ the beginning outlines for just how this integration may yet be achieved.At the heart of his thesis lies an interpretation of the nature of random events.In particular he is suggesting that the cause of the “random behaviour of particles in Brownian motion is directly linked with the volitional activity of the sum of observer-participators.Recent research into biofeedback has generated the distinction between what has been termed “‘active’?and “passive” volition.
Green (1972) has described this notion and the implication in the present context is that ~ via the techniques of biofeedback training, which seem to deal specifically with the training and direction of passive volition, it may be possible to set up an experimental situation which could Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/01/09 : CIA-RDP79-00999A000200010077-1 “directly: test the possibility of at least linking up : specific subjective states with changes in the patlern LO “,of events in the physical world. The research to ° inclica¥ccdate has clearly Gindcgted that certain sets of sub- jective states can be linked up with changes in the pattern of behavior of the body, though there has “yet to be a systematic exploration of the idea that passive volitional states may reach “outside” the van -body in'a manner at Icasi analirzous to the way active volitional states do so—ncither of which we .an explain.
‘The other aspect cf Sarfatt’s paper which may Spark some controversy is the suggestion that the discontinuity inherent in quantum theory involves the electron undergoing its transition between energy levels vin a path involving a tachyonic world line. Tachyaits have yet to be actually detected * put their existence is a logical extension of existing physical theory.Even if they are cciccted, it is not yet clear how they will relate to psychoenergetic theory, though strictly speaking, detection is the | ~ wrong word since it implics that tachyons should be “detectable” in the manner of a signal.The concept of a signal does not necessarily apply at -speeds greater than that of light (Feinberg, 1967).Since psychic phenomena scem to involve the need for revision of our concepts of time, it may be that the connetién will be via some relationship between the “time sense” of certain subjective states and the complex time of the tachyonic.
_world fine, though this has to be regarded: as a -completely speculative notion for the moment. Tt would appear that it is also essential that some model for the exertion of force by biological systems ’ is necessary for the further development of psycive- energetic theory.This, of course, must be in terms outside the normal active volitional exteasions via the action of the body.Research in this direction .szems to have been « part of the Russian effort to explain psychic phenomena for some time.In this direction Sarfatt has suggested the possibility of coe wn Waa.iO organic room-temperature supercon- : ductors2 bE found in biological systems.Some work in this area is already going on and further © development of this notion could provide explicit suggestions for further research.However, the kinds of research needed here are of the very best minds.
Perhaps when the scientific community at large realizes that the problems posed by psychic research are already part of the very fabric of science, rather than being some exotic pseudo-scientific intrusion, the necessary research effort can begin in earnest. In fact, it now seems clear that if Wheeler's concept of the role of the “participator” is to be fully explored, then physics might have to invent psychic research, if it did not already exist.Though clearly controversial in many aspects, ¢ hoped that the challenges and research iong/in this paper will serve to spark off ‘scienti direction in which it should always have been moving., REFERENCES Eigen, Manfred.Seiforganization of matter—The evolution of biological macromolecules.Naturwissenschaften.February, 1971.Feinbers, Gerald.Possibilities of faster than light particles, Physical Review, 1967.: .Green, Elmer.How to use the field theory of mind.In Biofecdback and self control.1972.Ed.by T.Barber ef al.
